1. Import libraries like- Matplotlib, pandas, NumPy
2. import the dataset
3. display the top 10 records of the dataset
4. Calculate Histogram for time spent on day calls by customers. Then find out in which day minutes a maximum number of customers lie on
5. How do we categorise the churner and the non-churner for the time spent on day calls(total day minutes)?
6. Find the number of customers who did opt for a voice mail plan
7. Create a boxplot for a categorical variable(international plan) and continuous variable(area code)
8. Create a crosstab for the area code to find the churner or non-achurner
9. How to pivot information using python for categorical values? Plot one
10. Now calculate the total international minutes for all the combinations above
11. Find Standard deviation of total night calls
12. Plot a distplot for the above result to look at specifically total night calls
